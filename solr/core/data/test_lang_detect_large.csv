This indicated worn brushes or even a defect in the rotor windings. Due to the extremely compact design, disassembly and reassembly were quite complicated and time-consuming. Since the motor itself could not be disassembled, we had to limit our troubleshooting to an examination of the sliding brushes and lead contacts as well as a visual inspection of the commutator.

However, since the entire button assembly probably has to be replaced and special tools are required to open and disassemble it, we unfortunately had to pass considering the advanced time. It's better to plan about two hours for such demanding repair work on such highly integrated and sensitive electronics. With a short message in advance, the right tools can be organized in time. The visitor can then decide whether to buy a spare part and come back with the phone at one of the next appointments.",en
anstiftung_2866,"The volume control as well as the treble and bass settings scratched unpleasantly. Furthermore, the operation in stereo mode was no longer stable and ""flickered"" constantly. A bit of contact spray applied to the rotary and slider controls helped against the former. The problem with the stereo mode, on the other hand, seemed to be more complex, which is why we did not pursue it further due to time constraints and without more detailed documentation. Perhaps we or the visitor will be able to obtain the corresponding circuit diagrams of the device. Then we could continue here next time.",en

The system could be quickly unblinded by the guest under our guidance. So, with united forces, everything that was in the way of the laser beam on its way to the silver disc and back could be cleaned. Now it had a clear view again and could do its work. We then readjusted the beam current a bit, for which there was a regulator. And with that, everything was like new.",en
anstiftung_2869,"Neither the CD changer nor the cassette drive could play music. Again, we found the typical problem of broken (or too long) drive belts. A short drive belt on the changer could be replaced without any problems and the system played the silver discs again. We could not replace the long belts of the cassette drives due to the lack of the corresponding spare parts.",en

anstiftung_2877,"A single broken electrolytic capacitor and the Profi Cook universal mixer of our next guest stopped working. The electrolytic capacitor was installed in the internal 12V switching power supply, which supplies the control module with voltage. Because of the defect, however, the voltage was too low, the controller and thus the mixer failed completely. After replacing the capacitor, the device finally ran again as before.",en

We initially suspected a defect in the heating element itself, but during disassembly and reassembly we discovered that only the thermostat regulator had slipped and was not making reliable contact. Reassembled correctly in the housing, the grill regained its old heating power.",en
anstiftung_2884,"Should supposedly no longer shred paper. We put the device into operation and pushed a few sheets in for testing, but they were shredded without any problems. Either she had previously tried it with paper shreds that were too narrow and had not activated the trigger switch in the feed tray, which starts the shredding unit, or she had set the operating selector switch to the wrong position. We explained the function to her again and also pointed out the operating instructions in the manual.",en

However, after this had been triggered in the past, it was no longer possible to reset it, as the switch was pressed into the housing and was therefore no longer accessible. To get to it, we had to open the case, which was only possible after loosening the hidden screws in the handle. However, the switch wouldn't latch properly in the end, so we recommended that the owner prevent it from being triggered again in the future and pull the plug as soon as the boiling point was reached.",en

After an intensive search, we were able to trace this ""quirk"" back to an overloaded LM7805, whose thermal protection shutdown triggered due to excessive temperature. With the help of a provisional cooling plate, which we fitted to the voltage regulator, we were able to improve the heat dissipation somewhat and thus significantly extend the time until shutdown. However, we did not find the actual reason for the overload, so the radio can still only be used to a limited extent.",en

anstiftung_2895,"A professional Italian ""A6"" coffee grinder from Faema was no longer in the mood for grinding - at least that's what its owner thought. Apart from the broken button in the coffee grounds collector, for which he had already procured a suitable replacement and which was therefore quickly exchanged, he had apparently overlooked a safety switch. This is actuated with the bean feeder in place and only then enables operation.",en
anstiftung_2896,"A ""Bea-fon"" cell phone constantly signaled a camera error and was no longer usable in this state. Judging by the error pattern, a break in the ribbon cable was probably responsible for this, as occurs with many phones with slider or flip mechanisms after some time.

The device had obviously not been designed for repair. Both halves of the housing were held together by snap locks and could also only be separated from each other after the tightly glued cover cap on the intake side was removed. Up to this point, the hair dryer had already suffered numerous unsightly blisters. Powered by a separate voltage source, the motor runs flawlessly. However, one of the heating coils, which also functions as the motor's series resistor during operation, is irreparably broken.",en

anstiftung_2926,"The battery of the drill was not charged by the associated battery charger. No wonder, actually, since the transformer in the plug-in power supply had no resistance on the primary side, so obviously a winding had blown or the thermal fuse had tripped. A new power supply would certainly not have been a problem, but the defect seemed to be triggered by an overload from the connected battery. In any case, the device drew a lot of current in operation with an external power supply. The owner therefore decided to dispose of the device.",en

While trying to shorten the length of the supply wires, the owner had unintentionally caused a short circuit by sinking the wire in the lamp housing. However, since the housing also acted as a return conductor, both conductors touched. Fortunately, it was a low-voltage lamp with ballast, so nothing worse happened and it shone properly again after the short circuit was eliminated.",en

anstiftung_2943,"A Teufel ""IP3000BR"" Blu-ray receiver suddenly went out during operation and now no longer shows any function. The last DVD played was therefore still stuck in the drive and had to be freed by us first. We then examined the internal switching power supply, where we suspected the damage. The voltage after rectification was checked, the continuity of some connections was measured and various electrolytic capacitors were tested for their ESR value - unfortunately without success. Without a circuit diagram, troubleshooting turned out to be too lengthy, which is why the guest cancelled the repair in the end and now wants to dispose of the device after all.",en

anstiftung_2946,"Powered by four button cells, a Brio electric toy train could normally go forward and backward, make sounds and light signals. Now, however, it did nothing of the sort. Testing with an external voltage source showed that the electric motor and LEDs were fine and the fault was more likely to be on the control board. After unsuccessfully checking some contacts and re-soldering numerous solder joints, the suspicion of a defective controller circuit hardened - unfortunately a chip-on-board and thus neither identifiable nor repairable. To save the good piece from scrap, we want to rebuild it next time so that the motor and LEDs can be switched on directly with the switch.",en
anstiftung_2947,"Things got nostalgic when repairing a Pentax ""P80-I"" 8mm cine projector whose motor wouldn't budge. By re-soldering some corroded contacts on the power switch and speed control potentiometer, it could be brought back to life, but the rest of the mechanics turned out to be quite sluggish and the drive belt also quite worn out. A thorough cleaning and lubrication of the gears brought the desired success.

The problem was that during the repair, the transponder for the electronic immobilizer - an RFID chip in a small, inconspicuous plastic component - was lost and the car could no longer be started with the key.

We gave the CD drive a thorough cleaning of the laser optics and also readjusted the beam current of the laser diode. After that, the device read CDs without any problems. We found worn drive belts in the cassette drive, which we couldn't change on site since it wasn't a standard size. However, this was less important to the owner than the functioning CD player, so we left it at that and only cleaned the device a bit from the dust of the years.",en
anstiftung_4318,"The coffee machine does not heat.We took a close look at all the connections inside, measured the resistance of the heater and the continuity of the thermal fuse, and found everything to be in order. The fact that the machine did not heat seemed more likely to be due to a problem with the timer control; probably the control circuit in the installed electronics is defective. Unfortunately, this is a special IC for which no replacement can be procured. Since the owner can do without this function, we will simply disable the control next time and install a rocker switch instead.",en

anstiftung_4326,"A couple came with their beloved LG ""50LB570V-ZB"" flat screen TV, whose backlight was constantly flickering. During troubleshooting, we first concentrated on the supply board and replaced two electrolytic capacitors with too high ESR. However, since there was no improvement afterwards and we also noticed the flickering on a regular basis, it is more likely to be due to a defective LED backlight. The controller probably switches off the supply voltage immediately after a defect is detected, so that the LEDs flash repeatedly and only briefly. Here, we first have to research for further circuit documentation and replacement LED strips before we can continue.",en

However, the new cell was not charged after the exchange. We tested the battery and found it to be okay, but noticed that the toothbrush always switched off immediately after being switched on.

anstiftung_6764,"A sound could no longer be elicited from this audio device - a tiny particle had broken off at the power button. However, this really very poor mechanical construction could be repaired again with a lot of finesse. With a connecting wire from a component, an eyelet was bent on a screwdriver blade. This eyelet was fixed with super glue to the rest of the ""power"" slide switch. After what felt like an eternity, all the individual parts were put together again to form a functioning radio - which could be successfully switched on again after the operation.",en

After soldering these wires, this defense device flashed and beeped happily again.",en
anstiftung_6767,Continued from 8/5/21:The power switch that the visitor provided has been installed.,en
anstiftung_6768,Unit had drawn in a large amount of water and stopped working. Motor disassembled. Carbon brushes were stuck in the corroded guides and had burned away- Commutator cleaned- Guides made passable- Carbon brushes ground back in.,en
anstiftung_6769,"It was no longer working. We opened the unit and examined the power cord and internal wiring. We found a tripped thermal fuse. After we replaced it, the plate heated the pot again. The cause of the defect was probably incorrect operation.",en
anstiftung_6770,It no longer charged the batteries of the associated hedge trimmer. An LED built into the plug-in power supply also remained dark. We were able to determine that there was no supply voltage from the plug-in power supply unit. We opened the plug-in power supply and measured all semiconductor components. This led to a short-circuited diode in the secondary circuit. This was replaced.,en

anstiftung_6772,"It always started up briefly and then stopped. We looked at the exact device and saw that it was very dusty inside. The sensors that tell the robot that it is moving towards an obstacle were also very dirty. As a result, they transmitted incorrect information and the robot always stopped right away because it ""saw"" an obstacle. We cleaned the device and the sensors , then he worked again.trigger here was lack of maintenance by the owner.",en
anstiftung_6773,"It would not settle to a stable zero when the scale was turned on. The display fidgeted back and forth and the scale did not start weighing because of this.

anstiftung_6776,"A connected CD player would sometimes go quiet and jiggling the unit fixed that. We opened the amplifier and examined the solder joints of the connection sockets, because they often suffer from the pressure of plugging and unplugging. Here, however, all was well. If you looked inside the sockets you could see the contacts tarnished black. So it was a contact problem. We treated the jacks and the source switch with contact spray. When reassembling, we noticed that the button from the power switch was broken off, so we glued that back together.",en
anstiftung_6777,"It no longer rotates. The owner suspected a defect in the built-in timer and had already disassembled the device. However, the timer was OK and the guest needed help with further troubleshooting and reassembly. It was clearly noticeable that the motor was sluggish. So we disassembled the motor and found gummy grease in the motor shaft bearings. We cleaned the shaft and bearing bushings with alcohol and lubricated them with new grease.",en

Durch systematisches Abklemmen und Prüfen auf Leckagen konnte das Problem auf das Heizelement beschränkt werden, das korrodiert war. Da das Heizelement in den Heizkessel eingelötet und nicht austauschbar war, musste der gesamte Heizkessel ersetzt werden, was mit erheblichen Kosten verbunden war und den größten Teil der Energie des Geräts verschlang.

Het apparaat werd gedemonteerd, er werden tekenen van lekkage en corrosie waargenomen op een scheidingslijn tussen een ketel met geboute flens, het onderdeel kreeg een foutmelding van een draagbare apparatentester, en verdere tests wezen uit dat het apparaat ergens kortsluiting maakte met de aarde. Door methodisch loskoppelen en testen op lekkage werd het probleem geïsoleerd tot het verwarmingselement, dat bleek te zijn gecorrodeerd. Aangezien het verwarmingselement in de ketel was gesoldeerd en niet kon worden vervangen, zou de hele ketel moeten worden vervangen, wat aanzienlijke kosten met zich meebracht voor de onderdelen en het grootste deel van de opgenomen energie van het toestel. De keuze voor vervanging van onderdelen werd aan de gebruiker overgelaten.",nl
